Java and C#  depend on usage of stack or heap memory locations.

## Java

Pretty much the same thing as C#, without raw pointers.

## C#

Supports using raw pointers which are unsafe code and pointers.  The point of raw pointers are to manage objects
where they are not needed to take a performance hit because of garbage collection.
