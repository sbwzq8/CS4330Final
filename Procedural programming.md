Derived from structural programming, procedural programming focuses on routines, subroutines, and functions.

## Java

In java it relies on organized procedures and it specifies the steps for a computer to take to reach the same output every time.

Although Java does have functions and struct's, it is better knownw for its procedural programming.  This is because of the classes and the way values are handled.

## C#

C# is very similar to Java, however it is slightly more procedural because of the way it handles a few values.

So C# is procedural just like Java, yet it does not follow it 1 to 1.
