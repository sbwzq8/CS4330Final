### Each language was designed with unique features in mind, and over time they have implemented more features that are common in object oriented and functional languages

## java
### Java was designed to be a portable language that could move between platforms without having to keep system architecture in mind. By compiling java code into java bytecode, it can be run on any machine that runs JVM, which makes it extremely portable.

## C#
### C# is built on the .NET framework, which allows it to operate with other languages that are based on .NET. C# also has the capability of contatining multiple classes in a single file whereas java must have a new class file for every class that is declared. Since C# classes are grouped by namespace, they do not have to conform with the directory structure, unlike java wich must conform with the structure. The namespaces can also be named separately from the directory. Properties do not need to have explicit getters and setters, unless they are private. Getters and setters are much easier to write when declared in the body of a property. C# also contains operator overloading, which is useful for creating alternative ways of calling operators such as allowing == to compare object values.
