Both Java and C# support functional programming, however C# has slightly more features.

## Java

Functional programming is mainly about programming using first class functions, aka where functions are treated like other values so you can pass functions to other functions and return functions from functions. AKA. AKA. Functions, Functions, Functions.  

Java takes advantage of functional programming with their lamda function.  They function as functional programming because lamnda functions are similar to functional.

## C#

C# has lamda functionas as well that does help make it more of a functional program.  C# also has generics and allows you to pass and return functions as values in other functions.
